Here's an example of a certain shape for $\mathbf{\Theta}$ that includes both weights and biases:

Let's say we have a linear layer in a neural network with $n$ input features and \(m\) output features. In this case, \(\mathbf{\Theta}\) would consist of the weight matrix \(\mathbf{W}\) and the bias vector \(\mathbf{b}\).

- The weight matrix \(\mathbf{W}\) would have a shape of \((m, n)\), where \(m\) is the number of output features and \(n\) is the number of input features.
- The bias vector \(\mathbf{b}\) would have a shape of \((m,)\), containing one bias value for each output feature.

So, the complete \(\mathbf{\Theta}\) would be a concatenation of \(\mathbf{W}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) along the appropriate axis. The shape of \(\mathbf{\Theta}\) would be \((m, n+1)\) to include both weights and biases.

Here's how it looks:

$$
\mathbf{\Theta} = \begin{bmatrix}
w_{11} & w_{12} & \cdots & w_{1n} & b_1 \\
w_{21} & w_{22} & \cdots & w_{2n} & b_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots & \vdots \\
w_{m1} & w_{m2} & \cdots & w_{mn} & b_m \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where \(w_{ij}\) are the weights connecting the \(i\)-th output neuron to the \(j\)-th input neuron, and \(b_i\) are the biases for the \(i\)-th output neuron.


A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of nodes, each connected to the next layer. It is commonly used for supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression.

In the context of MLP, let's define:
- $ \mathbf{x} $ as the input feature vector, where each element represents a feature of the input data.
- $ \mathbf{\Theta} $ as the set of weight matrices and bias vectors associated with each layer of the MLP.
- $ \mathbf{X} $ as the input feature matrix, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.
- $ \mathbf{W} $ as the weight matrix associated with each layer of the MLP.

The forward pass of an MLP can be described as follows:
1. $ \mathbf{z}^{(1)} = \mathbf{X}\mathbf{W}^{(1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(1)} $
2. $ \mathbf{h}^{(1)} = \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}^{(1)}) $
3. $ \mathbf{z}^{(2)} = \mathbf{h}^{(1)}\mathbf{W}^{(2)} + \mathbf{b}^{(2)} $
4. $ \mathbf{h}^{(2)} = \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}^{(2)}) $
5. Repeat the above steps for additional hidden layers if present.
6. $ \mathbf{z}^{(L)} = \mathbf{h}^{(L-1)}\mathbf{W}^{(L)} + \mathbf{b}^{(L)} $, where $ L $ is the total number of layers.
7. $ \mathbf{y} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{z}^{(L)}) $, if the MLP is used for classification.

Alternatively, the forward pass can be expressed using matrix multiplication notation as:
1. $ \mathbf{h}^{(1)} = \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\Theta}^{(1)}) $
2. $ \mathbf{h}^{(2)} = \mathrm{ReLU}(\mathbf{h}^{(1)}\mathbf{\Theta}^{(2)}) $
3. Repeat the above steps for additional hidden layers if present.
4. $ \mathbf{y} = \mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{h}^{(L-1)}\mathbf{\Theta}^{(L)}) $, where $ L $ is the total number of layers.

In both formulations, $ \mathbf{\Theta} $ represents the weight matrices and bias vectors associated with each layer of the MLP, while $ \mathbf{x} $ or $ \mathbf{X} $ represents the input features.
